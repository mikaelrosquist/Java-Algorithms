# Algorithms and data structures

In this folder there are solutions to different algorithm problems which we were assigned to solve in a course in algorithms and data structures in university.

This course taught me how to:
- Analyze data structures and algorithms regarding correctness and efficiency.
- Discuss the appropriateness, effectiveness, etc. of two or more solutions to the same problem.
- Implement and document common data structures and algorithms as part of a class library.

The course also taught me the meaning of and how to implement lists, stacks, queues, tree graphs, etc., as well as how to implement different algorithms including searching, sorting, hashing, and finally how to design and analyze them.
